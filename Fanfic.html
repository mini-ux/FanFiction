      The world of Harry Potter fan fiction can be highly overwhelming, especially if you’re a beginner. There are so many acronyms! And portmanteaus! And fan fiction tropes which have become so pervasive, even diehard fans might be fooled into thinking they’re genuine JKR products! (A good example would be Draco Malfoy’s middle name: contrary to almost every fan fiction ever, it’s Lucius. Not Abraxas).

    <strong>Clean by oliveblake:</strong>This book is part of a series, so when you sign up for the first chapter, you’re in for the long haul. Let’s start by saying that the characterization in this story is amazing. It’s some of the best we’ve read so far.

You’ll start Clean for the promise of Dramione and you’ll soon find yourself in love with every aspect of this story and you may even see yourself in characters that have already carved a place into your heart.

There’s something about the vulnerability of Hermione in this fic that stands out to us, and the way Draco embraces it.

Towards the end of Clean, Draco has a realization that Hermione is the only one for him and that means facing whatever comes his way; without argument.

It’s the kind of realization that gives you butterflies.
</li><br />
  <li>
    <strong>Out Of Order by worksofstone:</strong> Draco and Hermione are stuck together in a lift just before Christmas.

Que the romance.
Or at least the angst that (eventually) leads to it.

Oh, and by romance…we’re not exactly talking the Hallmark movie kind. It’s more the…you drive be absolutely bonkers but I’ve been in love with you for months kind.

Whatever path it takes to get them to love, they’re both happy with their endgame: each other.
